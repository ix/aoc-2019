* Advent of Code 2019

Easy to run thanks to [[https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/GUIDE/#script-interpreter][Stack script interpreter]], just do as-follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
user@host:~$ cat 1.txt | ./1a.hs # e.g. for day 1, problem A
#+END_SRC

You can also build binaries for all the solutions.
Just run `make`.
